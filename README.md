# FourierMotzkinSolver
C++ Program to perform Fourier Motzkin matrix elimination, and output. 

Fourier Motzkin Elimination is a procedure to determine the solvablilty of a linear system of inequalities. This can be used to determine the ability of linear programing to solve optimization problems. This made my homework a lot faster, and also was a lot of fun. 

Fourier Motzkin Elimincation is not efficient. In fact it is NP-hard and can grow exponentially. But it is useful for proofs of the Farkas Lemma.
